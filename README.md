# Kagi Small Web

Kagi's mission is to humanize the web and this project is built to help surface recent (7 day old or newer) results from the small web - people and stories that typically zip by in legacy search engines. Read more about it in the announcement [blog post](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web).

Few things to note:

- [Kagi search engine](https://kagi.com) now surfaces posts from the small web for relevant queries in its search results. 

- Try the [Kagi Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb) website to read and appreciate the posts directly.

- You can also use the [RSS feed](https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed) or access these results as a part of a broader [Kagi News Enrichment API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html). 

## Criteria for posts to show on the KSW website

If the blog is included in small web feed list (which means it has content in English, it is informational/educational by nature and it is not trying to sell anything) we check for these two things to show it on the site:

- Blog has recent posts (<7 days old)
- The website can appear in an iframe
